READ ME: Lab 3 - 8 bit sequence recognizer
This project is a one person group. A one person group, in minimum I am only responsible for the factory preset model.My secret code is 11110010
which is uniquely assigned to me for this particular Lab assignment. This submission packet includes a state diagram, state tables
both coded and uncoded, K maps, the four equations and the circuit schematic file of my 8 bit sequence recognizer. In order to design
my circuit I know I had to figure out the equations. To start I drew the state diagram which has 8 states so I know I need at least 3 D flip-flops. 
Each state is 3 bits. Once I was able to draw the state diagram using the "backbone" step discuss in this class I was able to created an uncoded state
table. Then I had to choose my state assignment for the 8 states. I chose to do the "natural way" of assigning states.
My only reason for assigning the states this way is that it is easier for me figure out where to put the "1's" on my K maps. For example, if D1
has Y1Y2Y3X (1111), I know that corresponds to the decimal value 15 which I can easily find in my traditional 4 x 4 K map. All the intermediate 
steps I took and solutions are included in this submission packet as pdf files.
